# XMAS_2020_Lights
  xmasTree2020: This is the light show for the outside Christmas tree.

2019:
We used xmas_tree_blend.ino for the inside tree before Christmas.
On Christmas day, I switched to XmasTree2_OTA.ino.

xmasTree2020.ino is based on xmasTree2_OTA.ino.

XmasTree2OTA.ino adds a single LED for the topper using a second data pin on the Wemos D1.
(Maybe merge some of the effects from xmas_tree_OTA.ino with XmasTree2OTA.ino).
